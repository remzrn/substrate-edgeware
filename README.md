# Edgeware-specific instructions

This is a modification of the substrate main node to match Edgeware functionalities. To setup the building environment, one can follow the instructions for substrate listed below.
Assuming the build environment is setup, the instructions are

Building  Edgeware alternode:
```
cargo build --release
```
Unfortunately, the runtime has changed so the old configuration formats do not match the new runtime. The chain needs to be generated with hardcoded chain specs
```
./target/release/edgeware-alternode --chain=mainnet-conf --name <INSERT_NAME>
```
At the moment, the chain id is incorrect because of the different configuration hashes. You should see an error about conflicting chain ids.

Below the original readme instructions for substrate:
